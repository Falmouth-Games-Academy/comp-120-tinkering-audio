# comp-120-tinkering-audio
main.py contains a series of algorithms that can generate and alter audio clips to produce sounds that will be used in my Kivy app.   
  
The algorithms are:
* Tone generation
* Tone combination
* Audio splicing
* Echoing audio
* Parsing tokens into audio 
* Randomly generating audio  
   
There is also a function for importing audio to be used in the algorithms and another to export audio ready for use in the Kivy App.

The Trello boards and cards folder contains screenshots of my trello board which contains the user stories and sprint plans I used when planning this assignment.  
The Gameplay Audio folder contains a couple of audio files I've created using the algorithms in main.py.
