Contract #2 - Sound Effect Generation

The programme must save the sounds effects it generate to be used later on.
It would have to generate mutiple sounds which  include pickups, jumping, death and a laser.
It would need to make the sounds fit for an 8-bit game style game.
(we can take inspriation from early mario/sonic games for this)
